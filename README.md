## Key Features
### 1. **Mathematical Computation**
   - Solves a variety of problems using mathematical expressions.
   - Integrated with **Math.js** library for robust mathematical evaluations.
   - Supports operations like:
     - Integration and differentiation
     - Algebraic equation solving
     - Matrix operations
     - General arithmetic

### 2. **Image Upload Functionality**
   - Users can upload images containing mathematical problems.
   - Future integration with OCR (e.g., Tesseract.js) or AI tools (e.g., TensorFlow.js) is suggested to process these images.

### 3. **Luxurious User Interface**
   - A stylish, gradient background for a modern and elegant look.
   - Clean and intuitive layout for ease of use.

## How It Works
1. **Input Field**: 
   - Users enter mathematical problems in a text box. Examples:
     - `integrate(x^2)`
     - `solve(x^2 + 5 = 0)`

2. **Image Upload**:
   - Users upload an image by selecting a file.
   - The app acknowledges the upload and hints at future processing functionality.

3. **Processing and Output**:
   - Text-based problems are parsed and solved using the Math.js library.
   - Results are displayed instantly in a formatted output box.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Incorrect or unsupported input is handled gracefully, providing helpful error messages.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Image Processing**: 
   - Integrate OCR tools like **Tesseract.js** or AI-based solutions for extracting text from images.
   
2. **Advanced Computation**:
   - Use external APIs like WolframAlpha for symbolic calculus and other complex operations.

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Improve the UI/UX for mobile devices.
